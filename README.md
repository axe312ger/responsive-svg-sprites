responsive-svg-sprites
===============

> An example approach to successfully delivery responsive svgs to all browsers - because it was really time to document this.

> Work In Progress - Even this readme :)

## :rocket: ToDo for publication

* [x] add svgo config for proper minification
* [ ] describe single parts and usage
* [ ] describe how to properly prepare the svgs
* [ ] describe why symbol and the other polyfill are used
* [x] add custom example file
* [x] add responsive methods to example
* [x] add proper ie polyfill to example
* [x] do cross browsers testing to proof this
* [x] create autopublish to github pages
* [ ] EXTRA: add animations & colorings to the icons
* [ ] EXTRA: postcss (just simply cssnext?) version
* [ ] EXTRA: add bad shaped svg files to demonstrate SVGO's power

## Install

This repo is meant as a demonstration and blueprint. It is not intended to be published to npm. So you need to clone it manually to your machine.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:axe312ger/responsive-svg-sprites.git
$ cd responsive-svg-sprites
$ npm install
```

## Try

The icons which are glued together by svg-sprite can be found in the `icons` folder. Feel free to add your own files.

The svg sprite is generated by simply running gulp or entering the following command to your command line.

```
$ npm run generate
```

All generated files can be located in the `sprite` folder. This includes the sprite itself, a sass file containing a map variable with the aspect ratios of every icon and an example with demonstrations how to use this in an actual project.

You can run the generated example(`sprite/example/`) with any kind of webserver. Or just visit the [github.io page of this repository](https://axe312ger.github.io/responsive-svg-sprites/). It contains exactly these files.

## Links

* The responsive approach in this repo is very similar to [this wonderful article of Sara Soueidan](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2014/08/19/making-svgs-responsive-with-css/).
A good read if you want to get a deeper understanding of the techniques used.
* Another amazing writing of Sara is her [blogpost about the svg coordinate system](https://sarasoueidan.com/blog/svg-coordinate-systems/). Learn how viewport, viewBox, and preserveAspectRatio relate to each other.
